# OpenCV Face Tracking

Use either server.py (SimpleHTTPServer-based) or flask.py (Flask-based).

Run the server on the device with the webcam, then run either client_test.py (to see a direct stream) or tracking.py (for face tracking).

The code is designed to run on Python 3 but may work on Python 2, although you may run into issues.
